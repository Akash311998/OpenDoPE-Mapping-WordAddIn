# OpenDoPE-Mapping-WordAddIn
A Word AddIn (similar to Word 2013's XML Mapping Pane) which handles conditionals etc

Developed in Visual Studio 2010; you should be able to use that or a later version.

Targets Word 2007 or later.

Compared to the standard XML Mapping Pane, this supports OpenDoPE content controls, including binding:

- conditions
- repeats
- pictures (including as rich text, for more positioning flexibility)
- Flat OPC XML
- XHTML

Generally, the user can set the binding in 3 ways:

1 dragging the XML element onto the document surface
2 right clicking on the XML element, or
3 using the ribbon
